Gelman-Rubin R value (see [GR92]_).

# A Markov Chain can only explore a local mode of the target function.
# The Gelman-Rubin R value can be used to determine whether N chains
# explored the same mode. Pypmc offers a function which groups chains
# with a common R value less than some ``critical_r``.
#
# In this example1, we run five Markov Chains initialized in different
# modes and then group those chains together that explored same mode.

# this defines the same initial proposal for all chains
