# The idea is to find a good proposal function for importance sampling
# with as little information about the target function as possible.
#
# In this example1 we will first map out regions of interest using Markov
# chains, then we use the variational Bayes to approximate the target
# with a Gaussian mixture.

# *************************** Important: ***************************
# * The target function must be defined such that it returns the   *
# * log of the function of interest. The methods we use imply that *
# * the function is interpreted as an unnormalized probability     *
# * density.                                                       *

# Define the target; i.e., the function you want to sample from.  In
# this case, it is a Student's t mixture of three components with
# different degrees of freedom. They are located close to each other.
# If you want a multimodal target, adjust the means.

#                           sensitive to W0. Its inverse should be chosen much
#                           smaller than the actual covariance. If it is too small,
#                           W0 will dominate the resulting covariances and
